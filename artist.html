   <p>Arpita Singh (born Arpita Dutta, 1937) is an Indian artist.  She was born in 1937 at Baranagar in Kolkata, West Bengal, India). Known to be  a figurative artist and a modernist, her canvases have both a story line and a  carnival of images arranged in a curiously subversive manner. Her artistic  approach can be described as an expedition without destination. Her work  reflects her background. She brings her inner vision of emotions to the art  inspired by her own background and what she sees around the society that mainly  affects women. Her works also include traditional Indian art forms and  aesthetics, like miniaturist painting and different forms of folk art, employing  them in her work regularly   </p>
