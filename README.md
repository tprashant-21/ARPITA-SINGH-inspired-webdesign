# aripta singh inspired website: ARPITA SINGH
 Arpita Singh has long been celebrated for the large, figurative paintings - vibrantly colorful and iconographically dense, these works gesture towards mythology and folklore, while drawing on the expressiveness of the line and textures evolved and developed during her seminal period of 1973-82. Singular in their allusion to contemporary Indian life, Singhâ€™s works forge a unique visual vocabulary and narrative sensibility that have had major influence on the generations of artists who have followed her.
